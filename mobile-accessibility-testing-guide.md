- **Mobile Testing**: BrowserStack, Device Lab

### Physical Devices
- iPhone (SE, 12/13/14 series)

- Tablet (iPad, Android tablet)
- External keyboard for mobile testing

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Semantic HTML & Screen Reader Navigation

#### VoiceOver/TalkBack Testing
- [ ] Navigate using swipe gestures - each element should be announced clearly
- [ ] Use "skip to main content" link - should jump directly to main content
- [ ] Check heading hierarchy - h1 → h2 → h3 structure should be logical
- [ ] Verify landmark announcements - "banner", "main", "contentinfo", "navigation"
- [ ] Test form labels - email field should announce "Email Address, required, text field"
- [ ] Check social links - should announce "Visit Finemesh Labs on [Platform], link"

#### Validation Steps
1. Enable screen reader on device
2. Swipe right to navigate through page elements
3. Listen for proper announcements and context
4. Verify all interactive elements are reachable

### 2. Color Contrast & Visual Accessibility

#### Contrast Testing
- [ ] Test all text against background - should meet WCAG AA 4.5:1 ratio
- [ ] Check interactive elements in all states (hover, focus, active)
- [ ] Test high contrast mode - should remain readable
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible and high contrast

#### Testing Tools
- Use Colour Contrast Analyser for specific color combinations
- Test with browser developer tools contrast checker
- Enable high contrast mode in device settings

### 3. Touch Target Accessibility

#### Touch Target Testing
- [ ] Measure all touch targets - minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Test social media icons - should have adequate spacing
- [ ] Verify form button touch area - comfortable for thumb interaction
- [ ] Test with different finger sizes and grip positions

#### Validation Steps
1. Use device's touch testing features if available
2. Test with various finger positions
3. Verify no accidental activations due to small targets

### 4. Focus Management & Keyboard Navigation

#### Keyboard Testing
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements - logical order
- [ ] Shift+Tab to navigate backwards - should work properly
- [ ] Test Enter key on social links - should activate
- [ ] Escape key functionality - should reset form when focused
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+K - should focus email field

#### External Keyboard Testing
1. Connect Bluetooth/USB keyboard to mobile device
2. Navigate using Tab key
3. Verify focus indicators are visible
4. Test all keyboard interactions

### 5. Form Accessibility

#### Form Validation Testing
- [ ] Submit empty form - error should be announced
- [ ] Enter invalid email - validation error should be clear
- [ ] Submit valid email - success message should be announced
- [ ] Test field descriptions - help text should be available

#### Validation Steps
1. Enable screen reader
2. Attempt form submission with various inputs
3. Listen for error/success announcements
4. Verify error messages are associated with form fields

### 6. Responsive Typography & Readability

#### Typography Testing
- [ ] Test text scaling (200% zoom) - should remain readable
- [ ] Verify line height - minimum 1.5 for body text
- [ ] Check text wrapping - no horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Test font rendering - should be crisp on all devices

#### Device Testing
1. Test on smallest supported device (320px width)
2. Test on largest supported device
3. Test in both portrait and landscape orientations
4. Verify text remains readable at all sizes

### 7. Motion & Animation Accessibility

#### Motion Reduction Testing
- [ ] Enable "reduce motion" in device settings
- [ ] Verify animations are disabled or reduced
- [ ] Test title animation - should be static when motion reduced
- [ ] Check hover/focus transitions - should be minimal

#### Testing Steps
1. Go to device accessibility settings
2. Enable "Reduce Motion" or equivalent
3. Reload page and test all animations
4. Verify content remains functional without motion

### 8. Performance & Loading

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test on slow 3G connection - should load reasonably
- [ ] Verify lazy loading for social media icons
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions
- [ ] Check for layout shifts during loading

#### Testing Tools
- Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling
- Test on actual slow connections
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Device-Specific Testing

### iOS Testing
- [ ] Test VoiceOver gestures (swipe, double-tap, rotor)
- [ ] Verify Safari reader mode compatibility
- [ ] Test with iOS zoom and text size settings
- [ ] Check Dynamic Type support

### Android Testing
- [ ] Test TalkBack gestures
- [ ] Verify Chrome accessibility features
- [ ] Test with Android font size settings
- [ ] Check Select to Speak functionality

## Automated Testing Results

### axe DevTools Checklist
- [ ] Run automated axe scan - zero violations
- [ ] Verify color contrast issues are resolved
- [ ] Check ARIA attributes are properly implemented
- [ ] Validate focus management

### Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
- [ ] Score should be 95+ for accessibility
- [ ] Address any remaining issues found

## User Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Screen Reader User
1. Enable VoiceOver/TalkBack
2. Navigate to page
3. Understand page purpose and content
4. Successfully subscribe to newsletter
5. Navigate to social media

### Scenario 2: Motor Impairment User
1. Use stylus or alternative input method
2. Navigate without precise finger control
3. Activate all interactive elements
4. Complete form submission

### Scenario 3: Low Vision User
1. Use device zoom (200%)
2. Enable high contrast mode
3. Navigate using larger text
4. Verify all content remains accessible
